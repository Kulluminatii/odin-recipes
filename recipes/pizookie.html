    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guys. It’s here. The ultimate Cast Iron Skillet Cookie. It’s gooey on the inside with crispy edges, slightly under baked in a cast iron skillet, and made with two types of chocolate.</p>
    
    <p>This dreamy skillet cookie is best eaten warm right out of the oven! Seriously, just grab a spoon and dig in. You won’t regret it. Oh, and don’t forget to top with vanilla ice cream too!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Browned Butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>200F</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>Pat the steak dry with a paper towel, and generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, and bake for about <strong>45 minutes to an hour</strong>, until the internal temperature reads about <strong>125°F/50˚C</strong> for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time if you like your steak more rare or well-done.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat the canola oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Do not use olive oil, as its smoke point is significantly lower than that of canola oil and will smoke before reaching the desired cooking temperature.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sear the steak for <strong>1 minute</strong> on one side, then flip.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, and swirl around the pan. Transfer the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Baste for about <strong>1 minute</strong>, then flip the steak with tongs and baste the other side for about <strong>15 seconds.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>Turn the steak on its side and cook to render off any excess fat.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
        </ol>
